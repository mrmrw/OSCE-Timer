# OSCE-Timer
Timer for medical student OSCE exams

There are two versions:
One with pre-set timers, one with customiseable timers.

Pre-set timers are:
Four-station loop:
  1. Preparation (2 minutes)
  2. Station (12 minutes)
  3. Feedback (3 minutes)
  
The customiseable one gets input for prep/station/feedback/stations and then runs the same loop.

Written in Python 3.

I intend to add a pause function and perhaps a better restart function at some point.
