# OSCE-Timer
Timer for UK medical student mock OSCE exams. Written in Python 3.

There are two versions:
One with pre-set timers (MoOSCE Timer), one with customiseable timers (MoOSCE Timer - Custom).

Pre-set timers are:
Four-station loop:
  1. Preparation (2 minutes)
  2. Station (12 minutes)
  3. Feedback (3 minutes)
  
The customiseable timer gets input for prep/station/feedback/stations and then runs the same loop.

After each stage, a sound (bell before prep and station, gong before feedback) plays before the countdown timer starts. Sounds have been downloaded from soundbible.com.

Future plans:
I intend to add a pause function and perhaps a better restart function at some point.
